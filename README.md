Beat Saber plugin to automatically download songs.
The following sources and feeds are currently supported:
 * Beast Saber: Bookmarks, Follows, Curator Recommended
 * Beat Saver: FavoriteMappers, Hot, Downloads, Latest
 * ScoreSaber: Trending, Top Ranked, Latest Ranked, Top Played
# Installation (BeatSyncConsole)
BeatSyncConsole is a standalone application that runs separately from Beat Saber (and doesn't even need Beat Saber installed).
* Download BeatSyncConsole.zip from the [Releases](https://github.com/Zingabopp/BeatSync/releases) page.
  * Windows users should use the zip that includes `_win_x64` in the name.
  * Not all releases may include BeatSyncConsole.zip.
* Extract the zip file to a folder on your PC.
  * It is recommended to extract to a folder in your user folder to avoid NTFS file permissions problems that can occur if you extract to a folder like `Program Files` or `Program Files (x86)`.
## Usage
* Run `BeatSyncConsole.exe`.
* On Windows, if you don't have an existing config it will ask if you want it to search your PC for Beat Saber installations.
  * Type `Y` and press `Enter` to automatically add Beat Saber installations to your config.
  * If Beat Saber installations are found:
    * If a single installation is found, it is automatically enabled and it will proceed with the default feeds.
    * If multiple installations are found, it will ask which installations you want to enable in BeatSync.
* The config files `BeatSyncConsole.json` and `BeatSync.json` will be generated in the `configs` folder.
  * `BeatSyncConsole.json` contains settings specific to the console app, such as target locations to download songs to.
    * The `BeatSyncConfigPath` can be used to use an alternate `BeatSync.json` file (such as the one located in your `Beat Saber\UserData` folder.
  * `BeatSync.json` contains the feed configurations and is shared between BeatSyncConsole and the BeatSync mod. You can view details for the feed configuration [Here](#feed-configuration).
  * Once configured, run `BeatSyncConsole.exe` any time you want to download new songs.
# Installation (BeatSync mod, not released yet)
* Extract the release zip to your Beat Saber folder (or manually place BeatSync.dll into your Plugins folder).
* You must also have the following mods for BeatSync to function:
  * BSIPA 
  * SongCore
  * BeatSaberMarkupLanguage
  * BeatSaverDownloader

## Usage
**First Run:**
* Run Beat Saber after installing the mod and configure the settings in-game (Settings > BeatSync) or in UserData\BeatSync.json.
* Beat Saber must be restarted (or disabled and reenabled via BSIPA ModList) for it to use the modified settings to download songs.

# Feed Configuration
Configuration can be done in-game in Settings > BeatSync or by (carefully) editing the BeatSync.json file in your UserData folder.

__Each feed has the following options:__
* Enabled: If true, BeatSync will use this feed to download songs.
* MaxSongs: Maximum number of songs to download from that feed. Set to 0 for unlimited.
* CreatePlaylist: Creates/Maintains a playlist using songs from the feed. Songs that are found by the feed but have already been downloaded are also added to the playlist.
* PlaylistStyle: If set to 'Append', each session will add the songs it finds to the playlist. If set to 'Replace', the playlist will only contain songs that were found in the current session (useful for ScoreSaber's ranked feeds so songs that get unranked are removed).

# Additional Information
* BeatSync maintains a history file for songs it finds in the feeds. This is used to prevent BeatSync from redownloading songs you've deleted. It is sorted in descending order by date the song was added to the history. This file can safely be deleted (or carefully edited) if you want BeatSync to download songs you've deleted in the past.
* If you use the SongBrowser plugin, it will not show the playlists in the correct order (i.e. TopRanked and LatestRanked will be out of order).
